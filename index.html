[x] draw out your component tree in excalidraw
[x] Have at least one Functional Component that uses props

The characters in the table should be sorted by votes as shown in the html app
The characters table should only show the first top 5 characters
The character cards should show all characters, and does not need to be sorted
We should be passing our array of characters (the data array) from the top to the children
You can transform that data either before or after sending it to the child component
[x] State should not be duplicated
[x] Variables should be named logicially
[x] No unneccessary console logs

[] Setup a github repository with your submission as the main branch, you will submit a link to this for grading (Not a Zip File)

note: See This Video on how to submit
[x] Get your react app to look EXACTLY the same as this html project

[x] Use props to customize components that are being used

[x] Use conditional rendering to render odd rows as dark and even rows as light with the "light" | "dark" class names

[x] Abstract any REPEATED UI into Components

[x] Use per-component CSS imports

For example if you have a CharacterCard.css you can have an import that looks like so
import "./some-css-file";

function CharacterCard() {
  // code goes here
}
